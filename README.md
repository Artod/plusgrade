# Income Tax Calculator API

## Overview
This application provides a robust solution for calculating total income tax based on marginal tax rates. It interfaces with a third-party API to retrieve tax rates applicable for specified years, allowing users to calculate taxes accurately for different scenarios.

## Features
- **Dynamic Tax Rate Retrieval:** Fetches current and historical marginal tax rates from a reliable third-party API.
- **Income Tax Calculation:** Computes total income tax owed by an individual based on their annual income and the specific tax year, utilizing the retrieved tax rates.
- **API Endpoint:** Offers a single HTTP API endpoint that accepts two key parameters â€” `annual_income` (float) and `tax_year` (integer). This design ensures that the interface is simple yet powerful, catering to a wide range of use cases from simple tax calculations to more complex financial planning applications.
